Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science and International Relations at the University of Geneva. I study the political economy of development finance and international organizations. In my dissertation, I explore the provision and effectiveness of official finance in support of private sector development in the Global South. In other projects, I research on compliance with international aid standards and debt transparency in developing countries. 

I graduated from Sciences Po in 2022. In 2024, I intern the OECD, where I co-author the Official Development Assistance-eligibility assessment of donors' private sector interventions and participate to the review of members’ reporting systems on development finance statistics. My past experience includes research assistant roles at Sciences Po and the Ecole normale supérieure - PSL in Paris.
